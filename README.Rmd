This repository includes material to introduce Git and Github prepared for a workshop at the Harvard Psychology Department Methods Dinner. 




- Text: https://happygitwithr.com/
- Variety of Git: Use Github via the Rstudio project
- Purpose: Introduce core concepts and git and facilitate getting started for your own work (collaborative work could come later).
     - A bit more of a pitch / lecture than a workshop, because actual tasks can be really varied
     - also: self-learning is useful, and Jenny Bryan's book is great for step-by-step following (in R)


## Setting up

- Get a Github account
- Make sure you have the newest version of Rstudio
- Keep <https://happygitwithr.com/> open

git for social science students (not software developers)
================

This repository includes material to introduce Git and Github. It both
serves as a demo that people can fork and clone,

  - Text: <https://happygitwithr.com/>
  - Variety of Git: Use Github via the Rstudio project
  - Purpose: Introduce core concepts and git and facilitate getting
    started for your own work (collaborative work could come later).
      - A bit more of a pitch / lecture than a workshop, because actual
        tasks can be really varied
      - also: self-learning is useful, and Jenny Bryan’s book is great
        for step-by-step following (in R)

## Setting up

  - Get a Github account
  - Make sure you have the newest version of Rstudio
  - Keep <https://happygitwithr.com/> open

## Git at work

  - Changes in regression specification
  - Keep track of different versioning
  - No more V1, V2, … V24,

## Outline

Beginning

  - what is the purpose of version control?
  - does an applied substantive researcher need git?
  - Difference between Google Docs/ Dropbox
  - files that are amenable to git (plain text, code, csvs) and those
    that are not (PDFs, docx, xlsx, jpg. etc..)
  - Common terms: Push/pull, commit, add

Middle Range

  - Using different branches
  - branching, forking, and cloning
  - Merging branches
  - command line
  - What is a “pull request”?
  - Using github (as opposed to git): keep track of new package
    developments, file issues, build a free website, build a portfolio
  - Other terms: origin, master, local

Difficult

  - Collaborating with different people (with Dropbox), merge conflic

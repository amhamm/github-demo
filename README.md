git for social science students (not software developers)
================

## About

This repository was made for slides to introduce Git and Github prepared
for a workshop of graduate students at the *Harvard Psychology
Department Methods Dinner* .

  - Jump to the [compiled
    slides](https://github.com/kuriwaki/github-demo/blob/master/presentation-slides/kuriwaki_github.pdf)
    (in the presentation-slides folder).
  - There’s not writeup (yet), so the slides are on the wordier side.
  - Any suggestions are very much appreciated.

## Outline

  - Text: <https://happygitwithr.com/>
  - Variety of Git: Use Github via the Rstudio project
  - Purpose: Introduce core concepts and git and facilitate getting
    started for your own work (collaborative work could come later).
      - A bit more of a pitch / lecture than a workshop, because actual
        tasks can be really varied
      - also: self-learning is useful, and Jenny Bryan’s book is great
        for step-by-step following (in R)
